    "intro": "The Good Boy Foundation is dedicated to improving the lives of dogs in Žilina, Slovakia. We rescue abandoned, abused, and homeless dogs, provide them with medical care, shelter, and the love they deserve. Our mission is to give these loyal companions a second chance at life by finding them loving homes. Beyond rescue and rehabilitation, we also promote responsible pet ownership and animal protection through educational and community programs.",
    "outro": "Our work is possible thanks to passionate volunteers, generous donors, and a community that deeply cares about animal welfare. We also organize spaying and neutering initiatives to address the stray dog problem and ensure long-term impact. At the Good Boy Foundation, we believe every dog deserves a safe, loving home and a happy life. Join us in making a difference – through volunteering, donating, or adopting a furry friend. Together, we can create a better future for dogs in Žilina.",
